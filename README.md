# Biologically Inspired Computation Courework 1
The main file with the neural network and genetic algorithm is 'genetic.py'

Dependencies are:
Python 2.7 and Numpy

How to run:
$python genetic.py

Parameter changes:
Parameters must be changed within the code.
Population and generation can be changed in the 'Genetically' method call at the bottom of the code.
Any sets put into the 'Genetically' method must be lists of tuples. For example:
[(0.1,0.2),(0.3,0.4),(0.5,0.6)]

Function changes:
All functions must be changed within the code.
The three usable functions are:
sphere()
rastrigin()
diffpowers()
Which all take a set as input.
